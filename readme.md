-   My experience: when I was working out a big statement, I needed to break it down into as small parts as possible. Problems are so much easier to handle little by little. Other than that, figuring out what the app does is very important before you dive into coding, just have a vague idea about what the app is doing.

-   Well, this was a nice one to play with, It was a good practice to use `useReducer` hook in react. Reducer is very nice because it is much easier to handle a lot of states and easier to share values(props) amongst any other files. Nice use of `Router and link` as well, I think this was a very nice project. Things that I learned during this project were useing useReducer, Router and useContext, those are really the big topics that I really got stronger after doing this project.

-   One thing I think is a wisdom that I would like to share is : it is very crucial to have a general idea about what the app is doing and start to break big problems to smaller once before diving into coding. No matter how tough it is, break the big problems down into as small parts as possible before tackling them. If you have a good base the likelyhood of having a good end is very heigh.

## Description

The main purpose of this app is for practicing react (react hooks). It was designed for front-end developers to boost their knowledge and their tool belt for their future work. One big part of this exercise also was getting familliar with using useReducer because it is so cool and react components context.
